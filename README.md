# hello-world
This is my first time using github hurray
I will enter college next month, I will study mechanical engineering but I also want to learn a little bit about proggraming because it is totally cool.
I love maths, physics and other exact sciences. I am self-taught and eager to learn new things. I like videogames and hanging out with my friends. I also like TV shows and movies.
I listen music groups such as U2, OneRepublic and The Killers most often and Maroon5 and Billie Eilish at times too, but I like other genres such as classical music.
I like salty and crispy food but I must admit I have a weakness for ice cream and chocolate (but who doesnÂ´t?).
I will be hanging around for the time being trying to learn something so wish me luck. Thank you.
